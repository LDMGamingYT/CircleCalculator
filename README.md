<h1>Introducing, Circle Calculator.</h1>
<h3>Circle Calculator is a Windows Forms App written in C# that gets the radius, diameter, circumference &amp; area of any given circle, using one of those data points.</h3>
<p>It started as a basic script, written in a Windows Batch File, but that quickly changed when I found out the command prompt couldn't understand floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals), only integers. I re-wrote the program in Python 3.10, which is downloadable in the releases tab, and although it did what it was meant for, it wasn't the most user-friendly program ever.</p>
<p>It is planned to have an installer for the program, but that will be available when it is done, for now, you may download the Python 3.10 file.</p>
<h2>How to use Circle Calculator:</h2>
<p>Upon opening the program, input the unit of measurement, as well as the information of the circle. The program will calculate the other 3 values for you.</p>
